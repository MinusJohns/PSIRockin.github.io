                        <p>HIGH TECH HIGH SCHOOL, a public school of choice offered by the Hudson County Schools of Technology, provides the children of Hudson County with a challenging academic program in a technology-based environment. High Tech High School offers four comprehensive vocational programs of study: Architecture & Design (AACT), Performing Arts, Science Lab Technologies, and Technology & Visual Arts. We create a community of diverse learners by developing potential through critical and creative thinking. We foster the expression of each student's individuality while delivering a structured curriculum adapted to meet the needs of 21st century learners and citizens. Within our diverse community of learners, students learn tolerance and respect while being challenged academically. Interpersonal skills are developed through collaborative activities that require independence and personal responsibility. Our programs build character and enhance problem-solving abilities in our students through student-direct activities, learning and extra-curriculuar activities. In a student-directed learning environment students reach their individual potential using state of the art technology facilitated by a skilled, innovative staff using applied learning techniques and collaboration. Critical thinking skills are developed through project-based learning, which requires students to effectively use resources, access and apply information, and navigate social and technical systems.</p>
